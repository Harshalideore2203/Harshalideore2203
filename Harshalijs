The error "Cannot read properties of null (reading 'click')" means that the JavaScript code is trying to call the `click()` method on an element that doesn't exist (i.e., `null`).

In this case, the issue is likely that the `inweeksSelect` element doesn't exist when the JavaScript code is trying to access it.

Here's an updated code snippet that adds some error checking to make sure the `inweeksSelect` element exists before trying to call the `click()` method:

```
const inweeksSelect = document.getElementById('inweeks');

if (inweeksSelect !== null) {
  inweeksSelect.click();

  setTimeout(() => {
    const dropdownMenu = document.querySelector('.ant-select-dropdown-menu');
    const options = dropdownMenu.querySelectorAll('.ant-select-dropdown-menu-item');

    options.forEach((option) => {
      if (option.textContent === '5') {
        option.click();
      }
    });
  }, 1000);
} else {
  console.error("Error: inweeksSelect element not found");
}
```

If you're still seeing the error, it's possible that the `inweeksSelect` element is being dynamically generated by some other JavaScript code, and it's not available yet when your code is trying to access it. In that case, you might need to add some additional logic to wait for the element to become available before trying to access it.
